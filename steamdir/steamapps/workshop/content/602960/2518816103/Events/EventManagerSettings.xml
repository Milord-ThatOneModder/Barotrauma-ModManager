    <!-- DefaultEventThreshold
      Event threshold determines how low the intensity of the current situation has to be for a new random event to be created.
      The threshold may increase over time, but is reset to this default value after creating a new event. 
	  Avoid decreasing this value as nothing will spawn. -->
    <!-- EventThresholdIncrease
      How much the event threshold increases per second. Can be used to make sure that new events will be created
      eventually even if the current crisis situation is not resolved (e.g. sub laying flooded on the ocean floor...) 
	  Avoid decreasing this value as nothing will spawn.-->
    <!-- EventCooldown
      Minimum amount of time between creating new random events.
	  This value can be edited to safely increase or decrease the difficulty. -->
    <!-- MinLevelDifficulty/MaxLevelDifficulty
      DO NOT EDIT THESE VALUES, these values control the imbedded biome location handling and will break the areas at which enemies can spawn at. -->
    <!-- FreezeDurationWhenCrewAway
      Additional main events don't trigger during this time when the crew (or more specifically, more than 50% of the non-bot characters) 
      is outside the sub (exploring a wreck, cave, ruin or a beacon station). Diving events will still trigger during this time. -->

  <Example (this is only an example to explain each value for the sets below)
    DefaultEventThreshold="0.5" Intensity Settings, Avoid editing
    EventThresholdIncrease="0.005" Intensity Delay, Avoid editing
    EventCooldown="120.0" Edit this line's numberic value (in seconds) to change the difficulty, this can make the difficulty change exponentially
    MinLevelDifficulty="0.0" Biome boundaries, DO NOT EDIT
    MaxLevelDifficulty="100.0" Biome boundaries, DO NOT EDIT
    FreezeDurationWhenCrewAway="180"/>  Edit this to grant a "grace period" when first diving.

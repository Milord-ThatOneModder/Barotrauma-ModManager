  <entitydescription.scp_osv96>A 12.7x99mm Anti-Materiel Rifle made to be more of an accessible weapon than the Coalition's precision machined, higher quality AMR.

  <entitydescription.scp_sr2>An 11.43x23mm SMG that has been derived from an already existing SMG design, it is extremely compact however due to the very short barrel accuracy is atrocious.</entitydescription.scp_sr2>

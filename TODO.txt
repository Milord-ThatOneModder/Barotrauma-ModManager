Issues:
- make an escape invalid xml of old names

    - steamcmd downloading all mods at once
    - go over all import, convert them to import only specific function
- fix and remake functionality to check dependencies of a mod
    - use steamapi instead webapi
- autmatically download all dependencies and enable them (except movable wrecks) (make it opt in opt out by command line just in case)
- functionality to selectivly force-update a mod
